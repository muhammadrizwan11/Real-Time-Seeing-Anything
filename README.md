# Real-Time Seeing Anything

🚀 **YOLOE: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection & Segmentation** 🔍  
This repository showcases real-time object detection and segmentation using **YOLOE** models, including **Prompt-Free** and **Text/Visual-Prompt** variations. 

## 📌 Models Used:

### ✅ Prompt-Free Model (`YOLOE-11L-SEG-PF.pt`)
- Detects **all** objects in an image or video without predefined categories.
- Ideal for open-world detection tasks where objects are unknown beforehand.

### ✅ Text/Visual-Prompt Model (`YOLOE-11L-SEG.pt`)
- Detects **specific** objects based on text or visual prompts.
- Allows precise control over detected classes.
