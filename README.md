# Real-Time Seeing Anything

🚀 **YOLOE: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection & Segmentation** 🔍  
This repository showcases real-time object detection and segmentation using **YOLOE** models, including **Prompt-Free** and **Text/Visual-Prompt** variations. 

## 📌 Models Used:

### ✅ Prompt-Free Model (`YOLOE-11L-SEG-PF.pt`)
- Detects **all** objects in an image or video without predefined categories.
- Ideal for open-world detection tasks where objects are unknown beforehand.

### ✅ Text/Visual-Prompt Model (`YOLOE-11L-SEG.pt`)
- Detects **specific** objects based on text or visual prompts.
- Allows precise control over detected classes.

## 📷 Predicted Images
Both models' outputs have been uploaded in this repository for comparison. Check out the `predictions/` folder for results!

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
To run the models, follow these steps:

1️⃣ **Clone the Repository:**  
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/muhammadrizwan11/Real-Time-Seeing-Anything.git
 cd Real-Time Seeing Anything using YOLOE.ipynb
```


## 💡 Applications
- 🚘 **Autonomous Vehicles** – Detect and classify road objects in real-time.
- 🏬 **Retail & Inventory Management** – Identify and track store products.
- 🔒 **Surveillance & Security** – Detect suspicious objects in video feeds.
- 🏥 **Medical Imaging** – Assist in automated diagnosis with object segmentation.
